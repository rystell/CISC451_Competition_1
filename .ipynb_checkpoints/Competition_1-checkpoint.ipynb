    "City of Kingston has an extensive transit network. The city maintains 23 routes helping connect the east and west urban areas of the city. The urban regions of the city are well serviced by the transit network. The data environment is prepared in this cell. City of Kingston data is fetched using the API. The data evaluated is all the table of all transit stops, table of all driveways (commericial and residential), and table of active busroutes in Kingston."
